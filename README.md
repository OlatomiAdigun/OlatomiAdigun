### Hi!!! I am Olatomi Adigun

A Data Analyst with a passion for transforming complex datasets into actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making. Expertise spans data analysis, predictive modeling, statistics, and machine learning, supported by strong programming skills in Python, SQL, and AWS. Recently earned a Masterâ€™s in Data Science & Analytics from the University of Calgary, with valuable industry experience from the Oil and Gas sector.

Before transitioning into data science, began a career as a Wireline Engineer, collecting and analyzing critical data from oilfields to support multi-billion-dollar decisions. A fascination with data and problem-solving led to a deeper focus on data analytics, with skills applied in roles at TOSSA Research and Kelanth Energy Services.

In these positions and through my academic journey, I have leveraged tools like SQL, Power BI, Python, Tableau, Docker, AWS, NoSQL, Git, GitHub, and Heroku to process and analyze large datasets, generate insights, and present data in ways that inform key business decisions.
